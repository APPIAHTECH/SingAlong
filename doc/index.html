                The salesperson of our small company for software development, OurCode, has been contacted by
                a company called SingAlong, who wants us to create a software application that implements an
                innovative business model in the music industry
            </p>

            <h1 class="title">Background</h1>
            <p>
                The founders of SingAlong, an independent record label, motivates the need for a software application
                by the lack of appropriate tools in the market for supporting the kind of business model that
                they propose. They explain their point of view:<br>
                “We are experiencing a time of change in the record label industry. The classical business
                model based on the sale of physical objects has been superceded by recent technical advances.
                Although the result is mostly negative for large multinational record labels, at the same time these
                technical advances present a business opportunity for independent record labels that can bypass
                traditional distribution channels previously monopolized by large players. It is also an opportunity
                for emerging artists to distribute their work on a much smaller investment.”<br><br>

                In this context, our client, a small record label called SingAlong, proposes to develop an innovative
                Web service that reduces costs by eliminating intermediaries. This way, the customers of
                the Web service pay less for their music, and the artists receive a higher share of the sales.<br><br>

                A brief description of the system: digital copies of some songs or parts of songs are distributed
                for free (but with the possibility to make a donation to the artist). The complete albums are sold
                over the Internet at a low price. The Web service also offers the possibility to compose personalized
                albums. An important part of the system is to enable customers to filter through available artists
                and songs, and provide different types of top lists (most popular artists, promising new artists, etc.)
                while taking into account the preferences of the user.<br>
