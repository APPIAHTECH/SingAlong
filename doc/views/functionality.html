                Description of the functionality
            </h1>

            <p class="subtitle is-6">
                We have carried out a couple of interviews <strong>brainstorms</strong>
                with the client and after cleaning up our
                notes – in no particular order – we are left with the following description of the functionality that
                the client wants to implement:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    • Both artists and customers (users) enter the system through a Web-based browser
                </li><br>

                <li>
                    • An artist, once identified (the first time they enter the system, an artist has to register)
                    uploads
                    their songs in Wav format (16 bits, 44.1 kHz). This way, we can use the file both to add the
                    song to an album, and to convert it into various compressed file formats, always optimizing
                    quality. For example, we want to avoid selling albums with songs converted from the mp3
                    format, or repeatedly decompressing and recompressing files.
                </li><br>

                <li>
                    • Together with the file, the artist enters the song title, authors, production date and
                    (optionally)
                    a description.
                </li><br>

                <li>
                    • The system has to automatically convert Wav files to different compressed file formats. The
                    current file formats are mp3 and ogg at 192, 128 and 96 kbps, but it is probable that in the
                    future some file formats are eliminated and others are added. Some of these files (except for
                    the Wav file) will be available to users for downloading or streaming.

                </li><br>

                <li>
                    • In case uploading large files is not possible (e.g. because of a poor connection) an artist
                    can also physically mail the songs in digital format (USB memory, CD, etc.) In this case,
                    the envelope has to be identified with the real and registered name of the artist. It is also
                    necessary for the storage device to contain a file “info.txt” that provides information about
                    the songs (title, authors, etc.)

                </li><br>

                <li>
                    • The songs on physical devices will be entered into the system by a human operator, who
                    needs access to the system via a graphical interface (not a Web browser).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>


    <section class="section">

        <div class="container">
            <h1 class="title">Albums</h1>
            <p>
                The artists can define albums, by simply providing a list of songs that appear on the album (the
                total size of the Wav files cannot exceed a given limit), a production date, optional comments, and
                a set of keywords that describe the music style (e.g. techno-ambient, electro-pop, pop, sixties,
                rock, metal...) The artist can also upload (via the Web-based interface) or send (by mail)
                promotional material in digital format.

                <br><br>
                An artist can, in theory, add the same song to different albums. However, this should usually
                be avoided in order not to confuse users that follow this artist.
                The production cost of each album includes a fixed part (not proportional to the final price of
                the album) that is paid to the record label. Knowing this amount, the artists can themselves decide
                how much to charge for an album. Both the prices and the proportion paid to the record label and the
                artist are flexible and can be
                modified at any time.

                <br><br>
                A customer can also purchase personalized albums, selecting songs by an artist of choice. If
                the artist permits, it is also possible to mix songs of different artists. In this case the total
                sale price is computed on the basis of the price of each individual song.

    <section class="section">

        <div class="container">
            <h1 class="title">Promotional material</h1>
            <p>
                The system accepts images (in jpg or png format), text (in PDF format) and videos (in mpeg
                format). The system should include a manual that explains to artists how to create and upload
                promotional material and which are the memory limits for each of the permitted file formats.

                <br><br>
                The system is in charge of managing promotional material and distributing it to users when
                they purchase songs and/or albums.

            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">

        <div class="container">
            <h1 class="title">Regular users</h1>
            <p>
                Regular users should also register if they want to use the Web service. This is because we want to
                track who downloads a file, votes for an artist or song, etc.

                <br><br>
                However, we want registration to be simple: the system only asks for a username and password.
                Optionally, a user may register their real name and email address. Registering emails enables the
                system to notify users of novel content that may interest them

                <br><br>
                Once identified and logged into the system, a user can search for artists, jump from one artist
                to another (in a way described later), and show information about an artist: which are the albums
                and associated songs, and which songs do not belong to any album.

                <br><br>
                Some songs can be downloaded individually (or streamed directly in the webpage). As previously
                mentioned, songs are grouped into albums that are sold as units. Each song and album has a
                rating and an area where users can provide comments or reviews. Each user can add a single vote
                or comment, but only if the user bought or downloaded the given song or album.

                <br><br>
                Optionally, a user can choose to purchase an album on a CD which is burned and subsequently
                mailed to the user’s address. In this case, the sales price includes the cost of buying, burning and
                mailing the CD. The cost of buying and burning the CD is fixed, but the mailing cost depends on
                the country of the user.

    <section class="section">

        <div class="container">
            <h1 class="title">Donations</h1>
            <p>
                The system should incentivize the culture of making donations. Even if a user does not purchase a
                song that they downloaded for free, they may want to thank the user by making a small donation.
                For this reason, on the download page there should always be a link for donating money using
                Paypal (www.paypal.com) as intermediary (Paypal does not charge a commission to the record
                label). It is hoped that the donations mechanism will help attract artists to the Web service.

            </p>
        </div>
    </section>


    <section class="section">

        <div class="container">
            <h1 class="title">Search</h1>
            <p>
                The system should make it possible to search for artists by name or by music style. The search
                result should be ordered by an overall rating (that we call “performance”) that combines 1) the
                outcome of voting, 2) the number of downloads, and 3) the number of sales.
                <br><br>
                The main page of each user will have three top-10 lists (although in the future, 10 could be
                changed for another arbitrary number): the 10 artists with highest performance overall, the 10
                artists with highest performance over the last 6 months, and the 10 artists with highest performance
                over the last 15 days.
                <br><br>

                It is expected, by nature of the open and unfiltered system, that many new artists will register
                and as a consequence, that many songs will be of poor quality. By itself, this is not a problem, but it
                is very important that the user can “separate the wheat from the chaff” (i.e. quickly find successful
                artists with high-quality songs). Otherwise, if a user hears several songs that they do not like they
                may not be motivated to return to the Web service in the future.

            </p>
        </div>
    </section>


    <section class="section">

        <div class="container">
            <h1 class="title">Similarity</h1>
            <p>
                The information about an artist (at the bottom of the page) should include a section that helps users
                find other artists that are “similar” according to some criterion. A list titled “people who listens to
                X (the current artist) also like...”
                <br><br>
                There should also be a second list titled “artists with similar style”. To generate this list it is
                necessary to take into account the percentage of songs of pairs of artists that have styles in common.
                <br><br>

                All lists are ordered by the performance of the artist
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>



    <section class="section">

        <div class="container">
            <h1 class="title">Notifications</h1>
            <p>
                Part of the main page of each user is dedicated to notifications. A user can subscribe to an artist or
                a style. The system automatically notifies the user when a subscribed artist publishes new songs.
                Likewise, the system notifies a user when a song of a given style is published.
                <br><br>
                One advantage of notification is to promote loyalty among users: if a user permits (by checking
                a box on their page) the notifications are also sent by email. Apart from the notification, the
                message sent also includes the top-10 lists. This way, a user that does not visit the Web service
                regularly can still receive potentially interesting information. Moreover, sending the message in
                HTML format leaves users one click away from the songs that they wants to listen to, and thanks
                to the notifications it is more likely that they visit the Web service more often.

            </p>

    </section>


    <section class="section">

        <div class="container">
            <h1 class="title">Unlisting</h1>
            <p>
                Both artists and operators can unlist songs and albums, removing them from the system. Once
                unlisted they are not visible to users (they do, however, remain visible to artists and operators who
                can later relist the songs and albums).
